### 235\. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

            _______6______
           /              \
        ___2__          ___8__
       /      \        /      \
       0      _4       7       9
             /  \
             3   5

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`. Another example is LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### 方法（一）
其实就是BFS第一个找到满足以下要求的节点
节点的值等于v或者w的值，节点的值在v，w之间
